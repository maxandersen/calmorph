## Calendar Morph

I wrote this little script to convert our massive company calendar that included company events + every company country holidays.
Having all that on one calendar made the calendar useless to me.

Lessons learned:

* You can only create 25 calendars pr. 24 hours

* Google calendar search are broken:
   Cannot search reliably for things with ',(,),, characters in the event.

* You need to wait 0.02seconds between calls to not overthrottle.

* Humans are really bad at manually maintaining calenders
   Germany - Germnay, Portugal - Portuagal, Holiday - Country, Country - Holiday
   Some events have multiple countries in a line, others have multiple events instead.
